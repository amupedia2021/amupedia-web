          <p>
            Founded by the students of ZHCET in 2021, Amupedia is the biggest
            platform to help fellow students through their college program. This
            initiative will cater to the academic demands of the students and
            assist them in every way possible. Everyone out there is
            running in the race to the top, and we here offer a push to anyone
            who needs it. Whether you come for the notes, read our blogs, or
            attend our events, you will emerge from Amupedia with new knowledge,
            perspective, influences, and connections.

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            The life of any student is not as easy as it may look like. There
            are so many problems of every student out there that we plan to
            tackle single-handedly with this website. Finding all the right
            documents and reference books and with reference video lectures can
            save a lot of your time and help you check off more things than you
            plan to. To that, we&apos;re even providing information on various
            competitive exams like GATE, SSCJE, etc. and notify you about
            verified sources of internships. AMUPedia is only looking out for
            all the students out there and our sole mission is to help you in
            making a bright future for yourself.
